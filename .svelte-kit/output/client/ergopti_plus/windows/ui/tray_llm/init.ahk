; MODULE: LLM Tray — Initialisation
; DESCRIPTION:
; Bootstraps the LLM tray module at script load. Reads persisted user
; preferences (passed in as a Map from ErgoptiPlus's main config loader),
; restores trigger shortcut + per-app overrides + API entries, registers the
; Ctrl+<n> profile hotkeys, builds the menu, and schedules the background
; health probe.
;
; FEATURES & RATIONALE:
; 1. Defensive priority reset: a crashed install would leave the process at
;    PriorityClass=High; every boot starts from Normal.
; 2. Typed restoration: explicit string / number / boolean / array key lists
;    avoid silently coercing the wrong type when a stale config carries a
;    legacy value.
; 3. Async health probe: avoids the 2 s blocking probe at boot that used to
;    swallow the first user keystrokes (see commit 6ac57794 history).

	; LLM_OllamaIsRunning probe blocked the main thread for up to 2 seconds
	; on reload, which delayed PrefixWatcher's InputHook startup and caused
	; the first few user keystrokes to be swallowed; (b) the multi-minute
	; download then ran in the background while the user typed, contesting
	; CPU with the input pipeline. The build_warning_row below now surfaces
	; the missing-install state in the menu so the user can re-trigger the
	; install themselves when they're ready.
