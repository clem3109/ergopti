--- ==============================================================================
--- MODULE: Keymap CoreState factory
--- DESCRIPTION:
--- Owns the shared-state table passed by reference to every keymap submodule
--- (Registry, Expander, LLMBridge, utils). Previously defined inline in
--- keymap/init.lua; extracting it here makes the set of invariants that the
--- submodules rely on explicit and easier to reason about in isolation.
---
--- FEATURES & RATIONALE:
--- 1. Single Source of Truth for initial values: a factory function seeds
---    every field from the canonical DEFAULT_STATE / DELAYS_DEFAULT tables
---    supplied by keymap/init.lua. Submodules never re-declare defaults.
--- 2. Closure-bound methods: suppress_rescan and suppress_rescan_keep_buffer
---    are bound to the new state table at creation time so callers never have
---    to thread the state handle through.
--- 3. Declared Invariants: comments on the index fields document which pairs
---    must stay consistent (e.g. mappings / mappings_by_tail_char) — the
---    Registry is responsible for maintaining these after any structural
---    change, but the invariant lives here with the state definition.

--- Builds a fresh CoreState table seeded from the canonical defaults.
---
--- The returned table carries:
---   - the rolling keystroke buffer and its synthetic-event bookkeeping,
---   - the mapping database (flat list + O(1) lookup + tail-char buckets),
---   - the terminator/delay configuration pulled from the supplied defaults,
---   - bound closures (suppress_rescan / suppress_rescan_keep_buffer) that
---     mutate the same table rather than any module-level state.
---
--- Invariants the Registry must maintain after any structural change:
---   * mappings_lookup[trigger .. "\0" .. is_word .. "\0" .. auto] points to
---     the same entry that appears in mappings (flat list).
---   * For every entry e in mappings, e.tail_char indexes it inside
---     mappings_by_tail_char; if e.has_magic then e.star_base_tail_char
---     indexes it inside mappings_by_star_tail_char.
---   * mappings stays sorted by (tlen desc, is_word first, group_order asc,
---     seq asc) at all times.
---
--- @param defaults table The DEFAULT_STATE table from keymap/init.lua.
--- @param delays_default table The DELAYS_DEFAULT table from keymap/init.lua.
--- @return table The freshly-seeded CoreState.
