; MODULE: Application State
; DESCRIPTION:
; Single-source-of-truth for all mutable runtime state that is shared across
; modules. Replaces the scattered top-level globals that were previously
; declared in ErgoptiPlus.ahk and read implicitly by every #Include'd module.
;
; FEATURES & RATIONALE:
; 1. Explicit ownership: every piece of cross-module mutable state is declared
;    here with a comment explaining its purpose and invariants. Modules that
;    need to read or write it reference AppState directly, making dependencies
;    visible in code rather than hidden by AHK's implicit global lookup.
; 2. Typed accessors: public setter functions (AppState_SetNumberOfRepetitions,
;    AppState_ResetNumberOfRepetitions, etc.) centralise validation and logging
;    so callers never write raw Map assignments scattered across the codebase.
; 3. Constants co-located: the immutable thresholds that govern AppState fields
;    (LAST_SENT_KEY_TIME_MAX_AGE_MS, LAST_SENT_KEY_TIME_PRUNE_AT) are declared
;    here so they sit next to the data they govern rather than floating at the
;    top of the entry script.
; 4. Test-friendly: the test runner seeds AppState via AppState_Reset() before
;    each test suite, giving it the same starting state as a fresh driver boot
;    without having to re-include ErgoptiPlus.ahk.
;
; NOT included here: CapsWordEnabled and LayerEnabled. Those two globals must
; remain plain AHK globals because they are referenced in #HotIf expressions
; evaluated by the AHK parser before any function can run — the parser does not
; support Map member access in #HotIf conditions.

; Any entry older than this many milliseconds is definitionally useless to the
; time-activation check — no hotstring in the codebase uses a window close to
; this. Kept as a constant so pruning is deterministic and easy to tune.
global LAST_SENT_KEY_TIME_MAX_AGE_MS := 60000

; Single global Map owning all mutable cross-module runtime state.
; Fields must not be added outside this file — open a PR to app_state.ahk
; so the ownership intention stays explicit and auditable.

	; -- Feature toggle state (session-only) -----------------------------------

	; Written by StartActivitySimulation / StopActivitySimulation; read by the
	; simulation tick callback and the gesture shortcut.

	; Boolean — true between an OneShotShift keypress and the next character.
	; OneShotShiftFix() clears it when the key is used as a chord modifier.

	; -- TOML serialisation lock -----------------------------------------------

	; while SaveFullConfig is already mid-flight. Never persisted; always false
	; at driver startup.
