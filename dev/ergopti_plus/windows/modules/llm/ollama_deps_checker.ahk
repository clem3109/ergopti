; MODULE: Ollama Dependencies Checker
; DESCRIPTION:
; Windows equivalent of the Hammerspoon ollama_deps_checker.lua.
; Ensures the Ollama binary is installed and the local inference server is
; reachable on http://localhost:11434. The heavy lifting is done by the shared
; PowerShell installer (_shared/llm/install/ollama_install.ps1); this module
; handles async invocation, output parsing, and drives the shared WebView2
; download_window UI (ollama_webview.ahk) — the same HTML/CSS/JS used on macOS.
;
; FEATURES & RATIONALE:
; 1. Self-bootstrapping: runs the shared PS1 installer silently, pulling the
;    configured default model automatically — zero manual setup for the user.
; 2. Silent fast path: when Ollama is already running, the check exits in
;    milliseconds with no UI shown.
; 3. Shared WebView UI: drives setKind / setStep / setDetail / addLog / update /
;    done via OllamaWV_* so macOS and Windows show the same window.
; 4. Rich progress parsing: extracts percentage, downloaded/total size, speed,
;    and ETA from ollama pull output lines and pushes them to the UI.
; 5. No-block execution: the Ollama reachability check and PS1 process are run
;    from a SetTimer callback — never from the main AHK thread — so the
;    keyboard and hotkeys remain fully responsive during install.
; 6. Hidden PowerShell: stdout is redirected to a temp file so no console
;    window appears; the poll timer tails that file every 500 ms.

/**
 * Hands Ollama installation off to the OS-native installer flow, then
 * polls every 3 s until the daemon answers.
 *
 * Why the simpler approach:
 *   - The previous in-process PS1 installer downloaded a ~1.5 GB exe
 *     via ``Invoke-WebRequest -OutFile`` (no progress streaming), then
 *     ran ``Start-Process -Wait``. The hidden powershell process spent
 *     10+ minutes contesting CPU + disk with the AHK input pipeline,
 *     causing the user's keystrokes to be swallowed mid-typing. Worse,
 *     the WebView never showed download progress (Invoke-WebRequest
 *     doesn't stream stdout), so the user thought it was frozen.
 *   - winget is the supported Microsoft package manager on every
 *     Win 10 / 11 machine. It runs the OFFICIAL Ollama installer with
 *     a normal UAC prompt and progress UI. The download is throttled
 *     to a separate process tree so AHK's keystroke handling stays
 *     responsive.
 *   - Fallback to opening https://ollama.com/download in the default
 *     browser when winget is not available. The user keeps full
 *     control over the install experience and we don't have to babysit
 *     a hidden subprocess.
 *
 * After the installer has been handed off, we keep a 3 s poll timer
 * pinging http://localhost:11434 . Once Ollama answers, the state
 * flips to "ready" and on_ready fires.
 *
 * @param {string} model - Model tag to pull AFTER the daemon is up.
 *                         Currently the responsibility is on the user
 *                         (Ollama's first-run flow handles it via the
 *                         installer's wizard), so this argument is
 *                         only kept for future use.
 * @param {Func} on_ready - Callback on success.
 * @param {Func} on_failed - Callback on failure (rare — only when we
 *                           can't even launch the installer).
