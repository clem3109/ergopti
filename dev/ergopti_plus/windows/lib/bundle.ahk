; MODULE: Compiled Bundle Bootstrapper
; DESCRIPTION:
; In compiled mode (A_IsCompiled), the .exe ships an embedded zip that holds
; every runtime asset the driver reads from disk: hotstring TOMLs, locales,
; the menu manifest, tray icons, language flags, gestures shared TOML, the
; ``_shared`` driver tree (WebView HTML/CSS/JS, LLM defaults, DB schema) and
; the native DLLs that DllCall expects. The bootstrapper extracts this zip
; into A_LocalAppData\Ergopti\bundle-<version>\ on first launch, then exposes
; the resolved path via the global ``_BundleDir`` so the rest of the driver
; can read assets without caring whether it runs from source or from a
; compiled binary.
;
; FEATURES & RATIONALE:
; 1. Out-of-band install dir: extracting to LocalAppData (not next to the
;    .exe) means a downloaded ErgoptiPlus.exe sitting in ~/Downloads or any
;    other folder does not pollute its host directory with ``static/`` and
;    ``vendor/`` siblings. Users keep their download folder clean.
; 2. Single ``bundle/`` directory: one extraction location regardless of
;    version. On version change the directory is wiped before re-extraction
;    so orphan files from the previous version cannot accumulate, and disk
;    usage stays bounded at ~one bundle worth (~10-20 MB) instead of growing
;    linearly with every release.
; 3. Version-aware skip: a marker file under the bundle dir holds the build
;    version string; if it matches BUNDLE_VERSION the extraction is skipped,
;    so the .exe boots without paying the ~250ms unzip cost on every launch.
; 4. No-op in dev mode: when A_IsCompiled is false, the module is a passive
;    no-op and ``_BundleDir`` is left empty — the dev workflow stays identical.

; ===== 1.1) Constants & Globals ====

; Stamped at build time by tools/build_static_bundle.py (see CI workflow):
; the literal string ``"__BUNDLE_VERSION__"`` below is rewritten before Ahk2Exe
; runs so the compiled exe ships with a stable identifier. In dev mode the
; placeholder stays as-is and we treat it as ``dev`` to disable any skip.
global BUNDLE_VERSION := "__BUNDLE_VERSION__"

; GitHub release URL frozen at build time so the tray menu's first item can
; deep-link to *this exact release* without an extra API call. The release
; workflow rewrites the placeholder right after stamping BUNDLE_VERSION,
; mirroring the pattern above. Empty in dev — callers fall back to the
; channel's "latest" page resolved at runtime.
global BUNDLE_RELEASE_URL := "__BUNDLE_RELEASE_URL__"

; Asset name pattern for the self-updater download. Frozen at build time to
; keep the runtime decoupled from the release-workflow naming convention —
; if a future rename happens, only this placeholder needs to track it.
global BUNDLE_RELEASE_ASSET := "ErgoptiPlus.exe"

; Update channel this exe was BUILT from. The release workflow rewrites the
; placeholder to "dev" for pre-release builds and "main" for stable releases.
; ``Updater_LoadChannel`` honours this as the default when no explicit
; ``[Updater] UpdateChannel`` override exists in config.toml — so a user who
; downloaded a dev exe stays on dev (and gets dev-channel update prompts)
; without having to flip the channel manually. The menu's channel submenu
; lets them switch afterwards. In source / dev mode the placeholder stays
; unresolved and we default to "main" for backward compatibility.
global BUNDLE_CHANNEL := "__BUNDLE_CHANNEL__"

; Resolved at runtime by Bundle_Init() — empty string in dev mode (callers
; must fall back to A_ScriptDir-derived paths), versioned LocalAppData path
; in compiled mode. Exposed as a global so every module can read it.
