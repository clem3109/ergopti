; MODULE: AppLauncher Adapter (AutoHotkey)
; DESCRIPTION:
; AHK v2 implementation of the AppLauncher port contract. Wraps the AHK v2
; built-in Run() and ProcessExist() behind three stable functions so shortcut
; modules can launch programs and query process state without coupling to
; AHK-specific function syntax.
;
; NAMING CONVENTION:
; Port method             → AHK name mapping:
;   AL_Launch(appPath)           → AL_Launch(AppPath)
;   AL_LaunchWithArgs(path,args) → AL_LaunchWithArgs(AppPath, Args)
;   AL_IsRunning(processName)    → AL_IsRunning(ProcessName)
;
; FIRE-AND-FORGET:
; AL_Launch and AL_LaunchWithArgs call Run() without waiting for the process to
; finish. AHK's Run() is asynchronous by default, which matches the port
; contract's fire-and-forget semantics.
;
; FAIL-SAFE:
; All OS calls are wrapped in try/catch. AL_IsRunning returns false on any error
; rather than propagating an exception to the caller.

; Launches an application by its executable path or shell URI.
; The call is fire-and-forget — it returns as soon as the OS has accepted the
; launch request.
; @param AppPath {String} Absolute/relative path to the executable or a URI.

	try {
		Run(AppPath)
	} catch {
		; OS-level failure — caller can check AL_IsRunning if confirmation is needed
	}
}

; Launches an application with command-line arguments.
; The call is fire-and-forget — it returns as soon as the OS has accepted the
; launch request.
; @param AppPath {String} Absolute/relative path to the executable.
; @param Args    {String} Command-line argument string to append.

		Run(AppPath . " " . Args)
	} catch {
		; OS-level failure — caller can check AL_IsRunning if confirmation is needed

}

; Returns true when at least one process with the given name is currently running.
; @param ProcessName {String} Process name as shown in the OS task list (e.g. "notepad.exe").
; @return {Boolean} True on success, false on error.

; and is callable without manually listing functions per-adapter.
